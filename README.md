How the game works

// The user clicks several responses to questions about pop culture
// at every question after the 1st one the user is asked if 
// they "wanna know what they know" which means are they ready to see
// the level of pop culture genius they have?

// A picture will appear that shows which level of knowledge they have
// for example if a user got all 10 questions correct they will 
// get a picture of Ken Jennings which is a calcultion of 10/10 
// Game will Track what numbers the user has already guessed and display those along with the picture
