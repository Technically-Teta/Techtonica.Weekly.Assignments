                I am originally from Monrovia, Liberia, in West Africa, and my parents and I immigrated to the US when I was only 2
                years old. I grew up in Minneapolis, MN. When I went to community college, I was encouraged to enter the nursing program
                as so many of my relatives were nurses. I knew after one Human Anatomy class that nursing was not for me! I was
                interested in Computer Science but could not afford to obtain a degree in the field at the time, so I graduated with an
                Associate of Arts Degree and continued to obtain a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration.
                Outside of college, I have always loved creating beautiful looks for people. I worked part-time as a self-taught
                professional makeup artist for nearly 20 years.
                After my role at my company was eliminated due to covid layoffs, I decided to use my time off as an opportunity to learn
                software engineering to not only challenge myself but to pursue the long interest in Computer science, so I decided to
                challenge my self to learn how to code. As I grew to love coding, I decided to pursue a software engineering career.
